How will you benefit? What will it cost?                                                                        |

| Meet stakeholder needs (product is solicited)               | Meet stakeholder needs (solicited project) - funded by the ultimate end-users (e.g., a state agency) or as part of a larger funding opportunity (e.g., BI of an NSFâ€¦). Stress ethical considerations required in this situation. |                                                                                                                                                    |
